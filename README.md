ansible-role-kubectl
====================

Installs kubectl command line utility used to interact with the Kubernetes API Server.

Versions
--------

I tag every release and try to stay with [semantic versioning](http://semver.org). If you want to use the role I recommend to checkout the latest tag. The master branch is basically development while the tags mark stable releases. But in general I try to keep master in good shape too. A tag `8.0.0+1.14.1` means this is release `8.0.0` of this role and it's meant to be used with Kubernetes version `1.14.x`. If the role itself changes `X.Y.Z` before `+` will increase. If the Kubernetes version changes `X.Y.Z` after `+` will increase. This allows to tag bugfixes and new major versions of the role while it's still developed for a specific Kubernetes release.

Role Variables
--------------

```
# "kubectl" version to install
kubectl_version: "1.17.4"
# The default "archive" will download "kubectl" as a ".tar.gz" file. This is
# about 2.5x smaller then "binary" but the tarball needs to be unarchived
# by the role first after downloading.
# If you specify "binary" the "kubectl" binary file will be downloaded. In
# contrast to the tarball the binary file is about 2.5x bigger but doesn't
# need to be unarchived by this role.
# If download file size is important for you (e.g. slow download or download
# over mobile link) stay with "archive". Otherwise "binary" might be an option.
kubectl_download_filetype: "binary"
# SHA512 checksum of the .tar.gz file (see https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.17.md#client-binaries)
kubectl_checksum_archive: "sha512:42907ace0672b839f656e3afa09827725cdb94980435b186221c36f7a9e2d6eb39b97ee4ef9848ed817066e6ba7c10d7d29b3e3674c82218c1f5ef1227668ae7"
