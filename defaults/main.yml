# The default "archive" will download "kubectl" as a ".tar.gz" file. This is
# about 2.5x smaller then "binary" but the tarball needs to be unarchived
# by the role first after downloading.
# If you specify "binary" the "kubectl" binary file will be downloaded. In
# contrast to the tarball the binary file is about 2.5x bigger but doesn't
# need to be unarchived by this role.
# If download file size is important for you (e.g. slow download or download
# over mobile link) stay with "archive". Otherwise "binary" might be an option.
